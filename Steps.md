<H4>Bean Priority</H4>
In case of a dependency is an interface which cannot be directly used than bean selection on the basis of name is only possible if the dependency variable name matches any of the implemented class or the used qualified operator.

However in case you have one primary bean than the priority will be given to the primary one over the named bean.
